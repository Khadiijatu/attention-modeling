# Modeling Human Attention Across Modalities

This repository hosts an independent research project on modeling
human attention as a function of content modality, content features,
and algorithmic exposure.

The project emphasizes:
- interpretable modeling,
- careful dataset design,
- explicit limits of behavioral attention proxies.
