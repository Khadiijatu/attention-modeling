# Modeling Human Attention Across Modalities, Content Features, and Algorithmic Exposure

**Status:** Independent research project (ongoing). Manuscript in preparation.

## Overview
This project investigates human attention as an observable, structured signal
emerging from the interaction between content modality, content features,
and algorithmic exposure.

The goal is not to claim a definitive measure of attention, but to build an
interpretable, quantitative framework that makes explicit what is measured,
how it is modeled, and where its limits lie.
